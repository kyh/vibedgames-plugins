# regenerate-3d Skill

> **Runtime:** Asset generation steps use the `vg generate` CLI (FLUX.2 / GPT-Image-2 / Meshy v6 / Seedance / etc.); the final deliverable is a static HTML page with Three.js and the generated assets bundled in. Install with `npm install -g vibedgames` (or `pnpm dogfood` in this repo). The generation credentials live on the vibedgames server, so there is no per-machine setup. See the `generate` skill for the command reference — including its async-job recovery rule (keep the `request_id`, resume with `status`, never re-`run` after an ambiguous failure).

End-to-end recipe to ship a polished, multi-character 3D web experience using generative models.
This is the recipe that powers a cyberpunk character selector with 10 unique operatives, each with a matching companion creature, environment-themed floor texture, animated background and color palette.

## What it builds

For each character you get:

- A **stylized 3D character GLB** (rigged + animated, baked into the file)
- A **companion creature GLB** (small static, themed to match the character)
- A **per-character PBR floor** (basecolor / normal / roughness / metalness, all generated)
- A **looped video background** keyed to the biome
- A **3-color palette** that drives the whole UI (CSS custom properties)
- A **portrait crop** for the roster card

All packaged into a single static HTML page with a Three.js scene. ~25–35 MB of GLBs total after compression.

## Pipeline

```
1. GPT-Image-2 → 1024x1536 character full-body T-pose (per character)
2. Meshy v6 → image-to-3d, enable_rigging=true, animation_action_id={chosen}
 → animated GLB (idle, dance, alert, etc.)
3. GPT-Image-2/edit → companion creature image, color-locked to character palette
4. Meshy v6 → image-to-3d, enable_rigging=false → static creature GLB
5. PATINA → fal-ai/patina/material/extract on the character image,
 returns basecolor + normal + roughness + metalness for the floor
6. Seedance 2.0 → fal-ai/bytedance/seedance-2.0/fast/image-to-video, 8s loop
7. gltf-transform CLI → resize 1024 → webp q80 → draco
 (typically 95–96% size reduction, ~400–800 KB final)
8. Three.js scene → MeshStandardMaterial floor with alphaMap circular cutout,
 mirrored reflection (refl.y = root.y, scale.y = -1),
 breathing animation on companions,
 per-character palette via CSS custom properties (--c1/--c2/--c3),
 per-character floor texture swap on character click,
 transition lines + radial flash on swap
```

## Riggable-character rules

Auto-rigging quality is decided at image-generation time. For any character
image headed into `enable_rigging=true`:

- **Full-body T- or A-pose**, front-facing, arms clearly away from the body,
  legs separated, symmetric. Whole body in frame — head to feet, no cropped
  limbs.
- **No props, capes, tabards, or long skirts fused into the silhouette** —
  anything that merges limbs into the body confuses the auto-rigger. Give
  weapons/props to the character afterward as separate meshes if needed.
- **Verify the generated image actually shows the pose** before spending on
  the 3D step. Models drift toward action poses; a cool contrapposto shot
  rigs badly. Regenerate with a stronger pose instruction rather than
  rigging a bad pose.
- **Body plan drives animation choice**: the mesh's stance decides how
  animation presets read. A quadruped walk on an upright dragon looks like a
  human in a costume; an upright biped clip on a hunched creature warps.
  Match the animation library entry to the stance you generated.
- Hard-surface armored designs (plate knights, mechs) auto-rig worse than
  organic silhouettes — budget a retry or prefer visible-anatomy designs.

## CREATE-YOUR-OWN flow

Visitors with generation credentials can generate their own character + companion live, in-browser:

```
flux-2 klein 9b (text-to-image)
 └─ character full-body image
 ├─ Meshy v6 (rigged + animated) → character GLB
 └─ flux-2 klein 9b/edit → companion image
 └─ Meshy v6 (no rig) → companion GLB
```

Cost: ~$2–3 per generation (4 generation calls). Runs in background, modal closes on Generate so the user can keep using the experience while the gen runs. The `CREATE YOUR OWN` tile transforms into a loading state, then becomes the new character card with a `↻ re-create` button.

## Three.js scene notes

- **Floor**: `PlaneGeometry(7, 7, 220, 220)` cut into a disc via radial-gradient `alphaMap`. High tessellation enables real `displacementMap` (uses basecolor as height).
- **Reflection**: clone of the root with `scale.y = -1`, `BackSide`, `depthWrite = false`, `renderOrder = -1`. For characters whose origin is at the feet, `refl.position.y = root.position.y` produces a visible mirror; the floor's `transparent = true; opacity ≈ 0.5` lets it bleed through.
- **Breathing**: per-frame `scale.setScalar(base * (1 + sin(t*1.3)*0.025))` + a small Y bob on companions. The reflection mirrors the bob so the mirror stays consistent.
- **Palette swap**: `:root.style.setProperty('--c1', hex)` etc. Every UI element (sparklines, pulses, bars, model pills, edge map dots) derives its color from `var(--c1)` / `var(--c2)`.
- **Normalisation**: Meshy vehicles/props come back facing ±X — yaw −π/2, scale by the length axis (not height), ground at y=0. Do it as a runtime `fit` per skin, not a bake, so a regenerated model drops in unchanged. Compress with `gltf-transform optimize in.glb out.glb --texture-compress webp --texture-size 1024`. Budget ~$1/model.
- **Floor swap**: `texLoader.load()` 4 PBR maps from `assets/floor/{charId}/`, dispose old textures, set `floorMat.color` back to white (since the basecolor is already char-themed).
- **Transition**: 9 diagonal lines sweep across the viewport (`@keyframes tfx-sweep`) on character click + a radial flash; bg video crossfades between two `<video>` elements; character GLB slides out and the new one slides in.

## Cost reference (curated build)

For one full character:

| Step                           | Approx. cost |
| ------------------------------ | -----------: |
| 1 GPT-Image-2 (character)      |        $0.04 |
| 1 Meshy v6 rigged + animated   |        $0.80 |
| 1 GPT-Image-2/edit (companion) |        $0.04 |
| 1 Meshy v6 static (companion)  |        $0.20 |
| 1 PATINA floor (4 maps)        |        $0.04 |
| 1 Seedance fast (bg video)     |        $0.08 |
| **Total per character**        |   **~$1.20** |
| **10 characters**              |     **~$12** |

Runtime parallelizes well, the original 10-character set was generated in ~10 minutes wall-clock with 9 concurrent jobs per stage.
