# Playtest

A build that compiles proves nothing. A game that renders proves almost nothing. **Playtesting proves it plays** — that the loop runs, input moves the player, the objective is reachable, and nothing throws along the way.

## The Tool: `vg playtest`

Everything here runs through one command. `vg playtest` is a passthrough to [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser), a native browser-automation CLI built for agents — `vg` installs it and its browser on first use, so **there is nothing to add to the game's `package.json` to drive it**. No test runner, no devDependencies, no MCP server to configure. (The one optional dependency is on the game's side: `@vibedgames/playtest` types and publishes the diagnostics contract below.)

```sh
vg playtest open http://localhost:5173   # launch + navigate (headless by default)
vg playtest snapshot -i                  # interactive elements, with @eN refs
vg playtest click @e2                    # act on a ref from that snapshot
vg playtest eval "window.__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__" --json
vg playtest screenshot /tmp/frame.png
vg playtest close
```

A daemon persists between invocations, so one-call-per-step is cheap and the page stays open across commands.

### Load the upstream skill for the general command surface

agent-browser ships its own skills and serves them from the installed binary, so the content always matches the version you actually have:

```sh
vg playtest skills get core       # the general browser-automation guide — read before driving anything
vg playtest skills get core --full  # + full command reference and templates
vg playtest skills get dogfood    # systematic exploratory testing / bug hunts
vg playtest skills list           # everything available on this version
```

**`skills get core` is the source of truth for the generic surface** — the snapshot-and-ref loop, sessions, waiting, forms, auth, troubleshooting. Don't re-derive it here, and don't trust a stale memory of it. An older agent-browser build with no `skills` subcommand falls back to `vg playtest --help`.

This skill covers only what upstream can't know: the game diagnostics contract, the scripted playtest, canvas/WebGL determinism, `--game`, and the traps we hit driving real games (see below). `references/cli-cheatsheet.md` is the game-shaped subset of commands.

**Playtest a deployed game with no local setup at all:**

```sh
vg playtest --game my-game        # opens https://my-game.vibedgames.com
vg playtest --game               # reads the slug from ./vibedgames.json
```

That is the fastest possible loop after `vg deploy`: ship it, then play it.

## Start Here: The 60-Second Smoke Check

Before anything clever, prove the game boots and doesn't throw:

```sh
vg playtest batch \
  "open http://localhost:5173" \
  "wait --fn 'window.__GAME_TEST_HOOKS__ !== undefined'" \
  "eval 'window.__GAME_TEST_HOOKS__.setState(\"active-play\")'" \
  "wait --fn '(window.__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__?.frame ?? 0) > 10'" \
  "eval 'window.__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__' --json" \
  "screenshot /tmp/boot.png"
vg playtest errors     # uncaught exceptions — must be empty
vg playtest console    # console.error — treat as product failure
```

`batch` runs the whole sequence in one invocation and returns one result array.

**Wait for the contract before waiting for frames.** A game sitting on its menu has a frame counter that never moves until `setState('active-play')` starts a run — wait on frames first and you deadlock on exactly the games that implement the contract correctly. If the _first_ wait times out, the game never published its diagnostics: it crashed on boot, or it doesn't implement the contract. If the _second_ times out, the hooks are no-ops.

**Treat any console error or failed asset request as a failure** unless you can name why it's benign.

## The Diagnostics Contract

The browser can see pixels; it can't see whether the player is stuck. Games expose two globals so a playtest can measure real state instead of guessing from screenshots:

- `window.__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__` — read-only per-frame telemetry (`frame`, `score`, `complete`, `player`, `entities`).
- `window.__GAME_TEST_HOOKS__` — the mutations a playtest may perform (`seed`, `setState`, `setReducedMotion`, …).

**The full field list and rules live in `references/scripted-playtest.md`** — that is the address `games/lunerfall/src/sys/diag.ts` and `games/starfall/src/shared/diag.ts` both cite, so it stays the one copy to edit.

`npm install @vibedgames/playtest` gives the contract as types and three publishers — `publishDiagnostics(read)` (a live getter), `publishTestHooks(hooks)`, `publishPlaytest(manifest)` — plus `isPlaytestRequested()` for the `?test=1` gate and `pointerTracker()` for cursor-steered games. Optional: the globals are the contract, and setting them by hand is just as valid. `games/pong/src/main.ts` uses the package.

Two rules worth knowing before you read it: JSON-serializable primitives only, never raw engine objects; and `seed(n)` must **restart** the run, not just reseed it, or everything measured afterwards is still unseeded.

Adding this contract to a game is a prerequisite, not an optional extra. Without it a playtest can only assert "pixels changed".

## Scripted Playtest: Prove It Plays

A smoke check proves the game loads; a scripted playtest proves it _plays_. It drives real held input and measures **progression**:

```bash
# This skill's directory. Claude Code substitutes CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR (project, global
# or plugin install); other agents fall back to wherever `skills add` put it.
SKILL="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
[ -d "$SKILL" ] || for d in .agents/skills .claude/skills ~/.agents/skills ~/.claude/skills; do
  [ -d "$d/playtest" ] && SKILL=$d/playtest && break
done
```

```sh
# from the project root
node $SKILL/scripts/scripted-playtest.mjs --url http://localhost:5173 --seed 12345
```

The bundled script (zero dependencies — just Node and `vg`) drives a scripted sweep of held keys and pointer moves, samples diagnostics **during** each step, and prints a JSON report. It measures four things: the loop survived (`framesAdvanced`), input reaches the player (`distanceTravelled`), the objective is reachable (`scoreAfter` / `stepOfFirstScore`), and the player never wedged (`longestStuckRun`) — plus zero console and page errors. Exit `0` means it plays, `1` means it doesn't and the report names which check failed, `2` means the harness itself broke.

Two defaults are deliberate, and both exist so a passing game passes: objective progression is a `warning` until you pass `--expect-progress`, and a game that steers with the mouse needs `pointer` steps rather than the WASD default. See [scripted-playtest.md](references/scripted-playtest.md).

The pass thresholds live in `THRESHOLDS` at the top of the script; read them there rather than from prose that can drift.

Adapt `--script` to the game's core verb: a runner holds forward and switches lanes, an arena game sweeps the space, a tower defense places towers through test hooks. Game-specific hooks (`forceWave()`) are encouraged where raw keys can't express the verb.

Metric meanings, flags, difficulty/fairness runs, and the key-dispatch trap: `references/scripted-playtest.md`.

## Autonomous Playtest: Let a Model Play It

The sweep proves the game _can_ be played. It cannot tell you whether a player who is _trying_ gets anywhere — whether the objective is findable from what the game shows, whether the first hazard is readable, whether a run ends in a wall. For that, hand the controls to a model:

```sh
vg playtest run --url http://localhost:5173 --goal "Reach the flag on the right; pits kill, jump them"
vg playtest run --game my-game --json        # the deployed game, full report as JSON
```

`run` is the one `vg playtest` verb that is ours rather than agent-browser's, so `vg playtest run --help` documents it and `vg playtest --help` (the binary's help) does not list it.

The loop runs inside the game's page. Several times a second it reads `__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__`, asks a decision-only model (straight from the page to the vibedgames API with a short-lived token — nothing to configure beyond `vg login`) which movement to hold and which actions to take, dispatches them as real held input, and repeats. Code does perception and keystrokes; the model only decides, and the decision latency is the hold, so it plays at about a player's reaction time. For fast games, a move in `__GAME_PLAYTEST__` can carry a `reflex(game)` that runs every frame while it is the model's intent — the model picks _what_ to do a few times a second, the reflex does it at 60 fps. Same report shape and exit codes as the bot, plus `decisions` (what it chose, how sure it was, `reflexFrames`, and `progress` — the model's own 0–1 read of how close the player got to the goal, first to last), `decisionsPerSecond`, `model` (calls, tokens, latency) and a per-decision `timeline`.

**Make the game playable by the model first** — that is most of the work, and it's the game author's. Publish what a player sees in `__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__` (nearest hazard and pickup as `dx`/`dy`, where the goal is, `canJump`), and describe the controls and the rules in `window.__GAME_PLAYTEST__` so the playtester needs no `--controls` file — `publishDiagnostics` / `publishPlaytest` from `@vibedgames/playtest`, or the bare globals. The snippet for both is in [autonomous-playtest.md](references/autonomous-playtest.md) § Make Your Game Playable by the Model; `games/pong/src/main.ts` is a live example.

Two things to know before trusting a run. **The model sees only the diagnostics** — no pixels — so a playtester that can't decide (`decisions.meanConfidence` below 0.3 warns) is an audit finding about the contract, not about the model. And **the goal is where the rules live**: what wins, what kills, which way progress is; the model has no memory between decisions beyond the `recent` block the harness supplies.

Run the playtester beside the sweep, not instead of it. The sweep is deterministic and free; the playtester is for the questions that need someone trying — onboarding, readability, difficulty at two decision rates. Flags, the manifest schema, what the model sees, and how to read a run as a playtest: [autonomous-playtest.md](references/autonomous-playtest.md).

## Canvas & WebGL

Two things will mislead you if you don't know them. **Read the renderer string before you believe a frame rate**: headless can land on the real GPU (`vg playtest` does on a Mac — an `ANGLE Metal` renderer) or on SwiftShader (bare Playwright `launch()`); the bot report's `gpu` field says which. SwiftShader means functional-only evidence — it renders lit materials black and drops heavy games to ~3–4 fps, so a multiplayer host on it reads as frozen; a hardware renderer (ANGLE Metal/D3D/Vulkan on a real device) is a desktop-GPU signal, still not a phone. A headed or Playwright-launched run needs explicit flags to land on the real GPU (`references/canvas-determinism.md` § Headless Footguns). And **headless can't capture WebGPU canvases on Linux/Windows** (the screenshot comes out black even though rendering worked) — a `--headed` problem with real consequences for what you report.

Determinism setup, readiness signals, flake classification, and the full footgun list: `references/canvas-determinism.md`.

## Screenshots and Visual Diffs

Visual comparison is built in — there is no separate image-diff tool to install:

```sh
vg playtest screenshot /tmp/baseline.png
# … make a change, reload …
vg playtest diff screenshot --baseline /tmp/baseline.png -o /tmp/diff.png
vg playtest diff snapshot --baseline /tmp/before.txt   # accessibility-tree diff, for DOM/HUD
```

A baseline taken without freezing the scene first is a flake generator — the freeze checklist and the "when not to take a baseline at all" judgment are in `references/canvas-determinism.md`.

A diff catches a change; it can't tell you the frame was wrong to begin with. For 3D, pair the screenshots with the visual-defect rubric in the `threejs` skill (`references/debugging-and-profiling.md` § Visual defects) — z-fighting, shadow acne, wrong color space, and DPR blur all render "successfully" and pass every smoke check.

**Metrics and eyes, both.** Appearance work reports numbers _and_ same-camera before/after pairs; a number that improves while the frame still looks wrong is a failure. A metric is worth most on the first problem and less on every one after — alternate a measured pass with a by-eye pass that carries no number, and ask "would you show this to someone?". A harness check can be true and useless: it covers what it was written for, not the frame.

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Sleep-driven steps** — `wait 2000` then click
✅ `wait --fn "window.__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__?.frame > 10"`

❌ **Screenshot-only verdicts** — "it looks right"
✅ Read `__GAME_DIAGNOSTICS__`; a screenshot is evidence, not an assertion

❌ **Asserting exact pixel positions** without fixed dt and seeded RNG
✅ Assert user-meaningful invariants: score rose, player moved, fail state triggered

❌ **Stale refs** — `@e2` from a snapshot two navigations ago
✅ Re-`snapshot` after anything that changes the page; refs are per-snapshot

❌ **`keydown`/`keyup` for game input** — agent-browser 0.34 sends them with an empty `code` and `keyCode: 0`, so Phaser and friends ignore them entirely
✅ Dispatch the event via `eval` (what the bot script does), and always release what you hold — see `references/scripted-playtest.md`

❌ **`set device "iPhone 15"` as a phone check** — viewport + UA only; `pointer: coarse` stays false, so it's the desktop build
✅ Held CDP touch emulation, and assert `coarse: true` before believing anything — `references/cli-cheatsheet.md` § Environment

❌ **Calling a game verified because it rendered**
✅ Run the bot; renders ≠ plays

## When You're Done

- [ ] Smoke check passes: boots, reaches a live frame, zero console/page errors
- [ ] Diagnostics contract exposed and honest (no silent no-op hooks)
- [ ] Scripted playtest moves, scores under `--script --expect-progress` with the game's core verb, and reports `longestStuckRun` ≤ 2
- [ ] `__GAME_PLAYTEST__` published, and `vg playtest run` scores within the run with `meanConfidence` ≥ 0.3 — or the diagnostics gained what the playtester was missing
- [ ] Fail state triggers and retry restores play (for games that can be lost)
- [ ] Deployed build playtested with `vg playtest --game <slug>`, not just localhost
- [ ] Evidence is fresh: a new run id / output dir whenever code or assets changed — never relabel an old report as current evidence
- [ ] Expected viewport/state pairs declared before capturing; a required capture that failed is listed as failed, not dropped

## Bundled Resources

- `scripts/scripted-playtest.mjs` — the progression-measuring bot; run it, read the JSON report
- `scripts/lib/harness.mjs` — the bot's `vg playtest` plumbing, held-key and pointer dispatch, motion tracker, boot and seeding
- `references/scripted-playtest.md` — diagnostics contract, metrics, difficulty/fairness runs
- `references/autonomous-playtest.md` — `vg playtest run`: making a game playable by the model (`__GAME_PLAYTEST__`), flags, what the model sees, reading a run as a playtest
- `references/canvas-determinism.md` — deterministic mode, readiness, flake triage, Phaser/Three.js specifics
- `references/cli-cheatsheet.md` — the game-shaped subset of the `vg playtest` command surface

For anything generic — the snapshot/ref loop, sessions, auth, waiting, troubleshooting — read `vg playtest skills get core` rather than these files.

## Remember

Any game becomes testable by adding one small, stable seam for readiness and state. The goal is not coverage — it's the ability to answer "does this actually play?" in under a minute, every time, without the human opening a browser.
