/**
 * scripted-playtest — drive a scripted input sweep through a browser game and
 * measure whether it actually PLAYS: loop alive, input alive, objective
 * reachable, no softlocks, no errors.
 *
 * Zero dependencies. Shells out to `vg playtest` (agent-browser). The daemon
 * keeps the browser alive between calls, but each call still pays a CLI start,
 * so the loop keeps invocations to roughly one per step.
 *
 * The game must expose the diagnostics contract — see references/scripted-playtest.md.
 *
 *   node scripted-playtest.mjs --url http://localhost:5173
 *   node scripted-playtest.mjs --game my-game --seed 42
 *   node scripted-playtest.mjs --url http://localhost:5173 --script ./sweep.json
 *   node scripted-playtest.mjs --url http://localhost:5173 --reaction-delay 300
 *
 * Exit 0 = the game plays. Exit 1 = it doesn't (report says why). Exit 2 = the
 * harness itself failed (browser missing, game never booted).
 *
 * For a playtester that decides its own inputs from the game state, see
 * autonomous-playtest.
