# Algorithm Walkthrough

The snapper recovers the true pixel grid from an upscaled/AI-faked pixel-art image in five stages. This file documents the pipeline at the level needed to debug bad outputs or extend the script. Algorithm and defaults are by Hugo Duprez (MIT — see `credits.md`).

## Stage 1 — K-means Color Quantization (`quantize`)

- Operates only on opaque pixels (`alpha > 0`).
- Initialization: `k` random pixels picked via a mulberry32 generator seeded with 42. Upstream Rust uses ChaCha8Rng — different bit stream, same idea.
- Iterates up to `max_kmeans_iterations` (15) until cluster centers stop moving (tol 0.5).
- Output is the source image with each opaque pixel replaced by its assigned cluster center color.
- Why this matters: subsequent edge-gradient detection works much better when colors are sharp categories rather than continuous gradients. A pre-quantized image has _sharper_ and _more localized_ edge peaks at the true cell boundaries.

## Stage 2 — Edge-Gradient Profiles (`compute_profiles`)

For each axis, build a 1D signal that summarizes "how much pixel-boundary energy is at this column/row".

- Convert RGB to luma: `Y = 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B`. Transparent pixels are zeroed.
- Column profile `col_proj[x]` = sum over all rows `y` of `|Y(x+1, y) − Y(x−1, y)|` (a horizontal Sobel-ish gradient with kernel `[-1, 0, 1]`).
- Row profile is the symmetric vertical version.
- Result: two 1D arrays where peaks correspond to vertical/horizontal pixel-cell boundaries.

The reduction from 2D to 1D is what makes the algorithm tractable and elegant. Each axis is an independent 1D problem; their solutions intersect to define the 2D grid.

## Stage 3 — Step-Size Estimation (`estimate_step_size`)

How wide is one true pixel cell?

- Find local maxima above `max_value × peak_threshold_multiplier` (0.2).
- Walk through them keeping only those at least `peak_distance_filter` (4) apart — de-duplicates ringing or thick edges.
- Compute consecutive differences.
- **Return the median** of the differences.

Median (not mean) is the key choice: it's robust to a few wildly-spaced peaks coming from noise or the corners of the image.

`resolve_step_sizes` then handles axis disagreement:

- Both detected → if ratio of larger to smaller is more than `max_step_ratio` (1.8), pick the smaller (assume the bigger is a detection error). Otherwise average.
- One detected → use that for both.
- Neither detected → fallback `min(w, h) / fallback_target_segments` (= /64). If you see exactly 64×64 outputs from inputs with no obvious pixel structure, this is the fallback firing.

## Stage 4 — Walk and Cuts (`walk` + `sanitize_cuts`)

Lay grid lines down across each axis.

- Start at position 0. Each step advances by `step_size`, predicting where the next cut should be.
- At each predicted target, search ±`step × walker_search_window_ratio` (0.35), with a floor of `walker_min_search_window` (2).
- If the strongest peak in that window beats `mean × walker_strength_threshold` (0.5), snap the cut there. Otherwise place it at the predicted target.
- Continue until past the image boundary.

Two key behaviors:

- **The walker doesn't force cuts into noisy regions.** If no strong peak is in range, it just uses the predicted position and moves on. This prevents runaway cut placement when the image has occasional clean spans.
- **Snapping prevents cumulative drift.** Without it, after N steps your cuts would be off by N × (true_step − estimated_step). Snapping resets the position to actual edge content each time.

`sanitize_cuts` then ensures the cut list is sorted, deduplicated, starts at 0, ends at `limit`, and is strictly increasing.

## Stage 5 — Resample (`resample`)

For each rectangular cell defined by `(col_cuts[i], col_cuts[i+1])` × `(row_cuts[j], row_cuts[j+1])`:

- Collect the (already-quantized) RGBA values inside the cell.
- Drop transparent pixels.
- If all transparent → output transparent.
- Otherwise → emit **the most common opaque color** as a single output pixel at `(i, j)`.

The output image is `(len(col_cuts) - 1) × (len(row_cuts) - 1)`. That's why your characters might come out as 94×96 or 129×129 — those are the discovered cell counts, not anything you set.

## Where the Algorithm Goes Wrong

| Symptom                                                      | Likely cause                                                                              | Fix                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Output is exactly 64×64                                      | Step-detection failed for both axes; fallback to `min(w,h)/64`                            | Input may not have a true pixel grid. Try a different `k_colors`, or accept that this isn't the right tool. |
| Output dimensions oddly small (e.g. 5×5 from a 1024² source) | Quantization collapsed too many colors → very few peaks → step estimate is huge           | Increase `k_colors` (try 256 or 512)                                                                        |
| Output dimensions oddly large (close to source size)         | k-means kept noise → many peaks → step estimate is tiny                                   | Decrease `k_colors` (try 16 or 32)                                                                          |
| One axis is squashed vs the other                            | x and y step estimates disagreed by > `max_step_ratio`; smaller pitch was applied to both | The source may have non-uniform scaling; pre-resize one axis before snapping                                |
| 1-pixel-thick "ghost" rows or columns in output              | Walker snapped a cut into anti-aliasing                                                   | Tighten `peak_threshold_multiplier` (in `Config`)                                                           |
| Colors look wrong                                            | k-means assigned mixed pixels to the wrong cluster                                        | Try a different `seed`; vary `k_colors`                                                                     |

## Mental Model

> Quantize → take per-axis edge histograms → median peak spacing gives the cell pitch → walk along each axis snapping cuts to nearby edges → for each grid cell, pick one representative color → emit one output pixel per cell.

The whole algorithm never tries to find pixel boundaries in 2D; it solves two independent 1D problems whose intersections define the final grid. That decoupling is what makes it robust.
