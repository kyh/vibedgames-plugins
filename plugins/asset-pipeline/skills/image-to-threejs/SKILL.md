Rebuild an object as **procedural Three.js code** driven by one generated
reference image. The output is a TypeScript factory — primitives, procedural
materials, and a named pivot/socket rig — not a `.glb`.

This is the 3D sibling of `animated-spritesheets`: generate one clean image with
`vg generate`, run it through a staged pipeline, get a game-ready asset.

## Pick this or a mesh — they are not interchangeable

| Need                                                         | Use                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prop that **hinges, opens, detaches, or breaks**             | **this skill** — the rig is the point                    |
| Prop you want to **tweak in code** (size, palette, variants) | **this skill** — it's source                             |
| Organic/photoreal shape, character, anything sculpted        | `vg generate` → Meshy (`model-catalog`, `regenerate-3d`) |
| Generic set dressing, many objects, ship today               | Kenney kit GLBs — free and instant                       |
| Whole scenes, crowds, LOD-heavy fills                        | **not this** — see the token budget below                |

**Budget before you start.** Upstream measures ~**80k–180k tokens per object**
and **150k–350k per character**, dominated by 5–8 render-review cycles. This is
for a handful of _hero_ props, never for populating a scene. The cheapest lever
is a good reference image — one avoided bad render saves 10k–20k tokens.

Every `create<Name>Model()` call allocates **fresh geometry and materials** — no
sharing between instances. Fine for hero props; for anything repeated, cache one
model and clone, or move to `InstancedMesh`.

## Setup

Upstream generator (Apache-2.0, Python 3.10+, stdlib only):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/img2threejs/img2threejs.git ~/.local/share/img2threejs
```

Upstream's README installs it into the agent's skills directory. **Don't** — it
ships its own top-level `SKILL.md`, so it would auto-load as a second, competing
pipeline doc alongside this one. It is a tool we shell out to, not a skill.

Run everything through `uv`; system python is often 3.9 and it needs 3.10+.

```bash
I2T=~/.local/share/img2threejs
run() { uv run --python 3.12 --no-project python "$I2T/$@"; }

# This skill's own directory, used by the commands further down. Claude Code
# substitutes CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR (project, global or plugin install); other agents
# fall back to wherever `skills add` put it.
SKILL="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
[ -d "$SKILL" ] || for d in .agents/skills .claude/skills ~/.agents/skills ~/.claude/skills; do
  [ -d "$d/image-to-threejs" ] && SKILL=$d/image-to-threejs && break
done
```

The target project needs `three`, `vite` **and `playwright`** installed —
`render_model.py` drives a real browser and resolves playwright by walking up
from `--project`, so a standalone project outside a monorepo that already has
it needs its own `pnpm add -D playwright && pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.

**Nothing updates the checkout for you.** This skill is verified against
upstream **v1.5.1** (`version:` in `$I2T/SKILL.md`). Upstream ships breaking
contract changes between minors (1.5 reversed how child transforms and sockets
scale, and made the generator refuse specs the previous version accepted), so
`git -C $I2T pull --ff-only` only when you are ready to re-check
`references/spec-contract.md` against the new source — never mid-run.

## The loop

`forge/next.py <spec>` always tells you the current pass and the exact next
command. When lost, run it. (Upstream also offers `forge/state.py init` +
`next.py --state`, a resumable checklist whose steps are its own grimoire
reads; it is optional — nothing in the pass gates consults it — and it is
where the 3-corrections-per-pass / 6-total hard stops live if you want them.)

### 1. Reference image

One object, isolated, evenly lit. The intake gate rejects busy scenes, and every
ambiguity becomes a review cycle later.

```bash
vg generate run fal-ai/flux/dev \
  --prompt "A single <object>, <identity-defining features>, three-quarter view, centered, \
isolated on a plain flat light-grey background, even diffuse studio lighting, no cast shadow, \
full object visible with margin, sharp focus, product reference photo, no text, no props" \
  --image_size square_hd --download "./ref/<name>.{ext}" --json
```

**Look at what came back.** Models routinely ignore the view angle — a
"three-quarter view" request often returns dead-on frontal, which hides the depth
axis and makes every depth a guess. Re-roll; it is far cheaper than guessing.

### 2. Intake and assessment

```bash
run forge/stage1_intake/probe_image.py ref/<name>.jpg
run forge/stage1_intake/check_reference_admission.py ref/<name>.jpg
run forge/stage2_spec/new_pre_spec_assessment.py "<Name>" --image ref/<name>.jpg \
    --complexity moderate --out assessment.json

# STOP. Fill assessment.json from what you see BEFORE the next command —
# new_sculpt_spec.py copies the assessment into the spec at creation, so
# running straight through bakes an empty scaffold in.

run forge/stage2_spec/new_sculpt_spec.py "<Name>" --image ref/<name>.jpg \
    --assessment assessment.json --out spec.json
```

Both emit **scaffolds** — zeros, `"unassessed"`, and a single placeholder
component. That is the deal throughout: **the scripts enforce structure, you
supply every judgment.** Field shapes are strict (enums, integer 0–3 scores —
see `references/spec-contract.md`). Then author `componentTree` and
`materials` yourself.

**The whole spec is due before the first factory.** The generator refuses to
write anything while `validate_sculpt_spec.py --strict-quality` reports a
single `quality:` warning — and a fresh scaffold carries 15 of them. There is
no "fill materials at material-pass" any more: every material needs
`referencePbr` extracted from reference crops, every component a
`colorMaterialRecipe`, `lightingFromPhoto` needs ≥ 3 concrete lights,
materials need wear/local-override entries, `detailInventory` must reach
`targetMinDetails`, and the assessment's `unknownsToResolveBeforeImplementation`
must be emptied (move each unknown into a `featureReviewTargets` entry or a
review note — the list itself is the block). Budget intake accordingly; it is
front-loaded work, not skipped work.

> **Never re-run `new_sculpt_spec.py --force` on a live spec.** It reseeds the
> file and wipes `reviewHistory`, which is what credits completed passes — you
> silently drop back to blockout. Edit the spec in place instead.

### 3. Author the spec

Measure proportions off the reference instead of eyeballing them; it is the
difference between "a chest" and "the chest". Then check with `contact.json`
from the renderer: bounds `H/W` should match what you measured. Crop-zoom 2–4
ambiguous regions of the reference (`scripts/align_framing.py crop`, or the
detail-inventory grid from `build_detail_inventory.py --out-dir <dir>`) and
verify part adjacency before authoring — the full frame hides things like a recessed barrel head or which
block a flange sits under.

**Geometry is driven by three mechanisms, and mixing them up is the single
biggest time sink** (full contract: `references/spec-contract.md`):

| Mechanism                        | When it applies                                                | What it makes                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `transform.scale`                | any primitive without a round-primitive attachment             | unit primitive, scale baked into its vertices  |
| `attachment.localStart/localEnd` | `attachment` on a **round** primitive (cylinder/cone/capsule…) | oriented cylinder swept between the two points |
| `geometryDescriptor` profiles    | `lathe`/`extrude`/`tube`/`curve-sweep`/`tapered-sweep`         | real profiles: bellies, curved arms, horns     |

- Geometry is emitted as **unit** primitives. **`dimensions` is documentation
  only** — it never sizes anything. `transform.scale` does — and it is baked
  into the geometry; the `__pivot` Group always carries scale `1`.
- Consequence: **children and sockets live in the parent's _unscaled_ frame.**
  A child at `[0.5, 0, 0]` under a parent scaled `[2, 1, 1]` sits 0.5 units
  out, not 1.0; a socket's `localPosition` is in real units too. Do not divide
  out a parent's scale — that was the pre-1.5 contract and now misplaces parts.
- An `attachment` **replaces** the authored primitive with a swept cylinder
  only when the primitive is round (`cylinder, cone, capsule, tube,
curve-sweep`); `baseRadius` default `0.06`, tapering to `endRadius` =
  `0.55 × baseRadius`. On a `box`/`torus`/profile primitive the geometry is
  kept and the attachment is just an anchor contract the review gates read.
  There is **no plate mode** — flat straps are a box component; untapered
  bands set `baseRadius === endRadius`.
- Attachments are required only where the validator's role/**name-token**
  matching fires (`hinge`, `handle`, `arm`, `support`, …) or the primitive is
  round — NOT on every meso child. Corollary: naming a round part
  `hinge-upper` force-converts it to a rod, and its `__pivot` then sits at
  `localStart` (a real joint) instead of `transform.position`. A ring handle
  is a `torus` with role `pull-ring`, never "handle".
- A swollen barrel is a **lathe**, not a scaled cylinder; an S-curved lever arm
  is a `curve-sweep`; anything that comes to a point (horn, spike, tail) is a
  `tapered-sweep` with per-station radii. Reaching for scale tricks where a
  profile exists is how the belly and the curve get lost.
- Multiple parentless macro parts are fine (they attach to an invisible
  Group). Only the scaffold's placeholder `root` **component** renders as a
  unit cube — delete or repurpose it; don't invent a giant carrier box.
- `performanceBudget.targetTriangles` picks the tessellation tier for every
  segmented primitive (≤ 6k low, ≤ 60k standard, else hero — and hero is
  the old default, so an absent budget changes nothing).

**The rig is where the token spend pays off — but know what is real:**

- **`actionProfile.pivot` is metadata the generator never applies.** The
  `__pivot` node sits at `transform.position` with the mesh centered on it.
  A real off-center hinge is an **armature you author**: a carrier component
  whose `transform.position` IS the hinge line, with every swinging part as
  its child. Keep the carrier's name canonical (`"<leaf-id>__pivot"`) — a
  rerun that renames the swing node breaks every `getObjectByName` caller.
- **`sockets`** reach the runtime as named `Object3D`s, but tooling finds them
  by the substring `socket` in the id — an id without it silently reports
  `sockets: []`. Articulated objects get a minimum set: hinge/pintle, handle,
  latch.
- **Prove the rig**: render the hinge carrier rotated to its open pose through
  the same camera into `runs/<pass>-pulled/`. An unpulled rig is unverified.

Validate before generating — strict is the gate the generator itself runs:

```bash
run forge/stage2_spec/validate_sculpt_spec.py spec.json --strict-quality   # want: PASS
```

Field shapes the validator rejects guesses on (enums, integer 0–3 scores,
evidenceRefs as view IDs, the 15-value primitive enum) are catalogued in
`references/spec-contract.md`; `validate_sculpt_spec.py` itself is the enum
source of truth. Two errors bite every first run: `primitive` must come from
the enum, and `materialLayers` must point at your material ids, not the seeded
`"base"`. Every `quality:` warning is a strict failure and blocks
`generate_threejs_factory.py` (it prints a `BLOCKED` report and writes
nothing). `--allow-nonstrict` emits byte-identical code but cannot take
`--pass-id` (it builds whatever pass is currently unlocked) — use it for a
throwaway proportion render while intake is still in progress, never to
credit a pass.

### 3b. Extract the material evidence (before the first factory)

Strict quality blocks codegen until **every** material carries usable
`referencePbr`, so this is loop work now, not material-pass work. One crop per
material, taken off the part you think it is:

```bash
run forge/stage1_intake/analyze_texture.py crops/<mat>.png \
    --spec spec.json --material-id <mat> --in-place
run forge/stage1_intake/extract_pbr_evidence.py crops/<mat>.png \
    --out-dir public/pbr/<mat> --url-prefix /pbr/<mat> \
    --material-id <mat> --spec spec.json --in-place --allow-low-confidence
```

`--spec ... --in-place` is what actually writes `referencePbr` onto the
material; without it the maps land on disk and strict still refuses.
`--allow-low-confidence` is the normal path, not a shortcut: confidence caps
around 0.6 on clean crops while the threshold is 0.7, and the script refuses
to patch the spec otherwise.

A material with no croppable pixels (a groove colour that exists only as 4px
seam lines) still needs one — stitch the cleanest columns of that zone into a
synthetic crop and extract from that. Then fix exposure: see the
double-exposure trap in `references/spec-contract.md` before believing the
first render.

### 4. Generate, normalize, render

`$SKILL` below is this skill's directory (set in [Setup](#setup)).

```bash
run forge/stage3_build/generate_threejs_factory.py spec.json \
    --out src/model/<name>-factory.generated.ts --pass-id blockout --force

node $SKILL/scripts/normalize-factory.mjs \
    src/model/<name>-factory.generated.ts

uv run --python 3.12 --no-project $SKILL/scripts/render_model.py \
    --project <vite-project> --factory src/model/<name>-factory.generated.ts \
    --export create<Name>Model --out-dir runs/blockout --views front,three-quarter
```

`generate_threejs_factory.py` needs `--force` on every regeneration over an
existing file — that is a normal loop step, unlike `new_sculpt_spec.py --force`,
which wipes your pass credits and is never routine.

`render_model.py` mounts the factory in a throwaway Vite entry, frames it by its
own bounding box, and shoots fixed angles — the gate wants a browser render and
upstream leaves producing one to you. Run it **twice per pass**: once lit, once
with `--map-stripped` (a whole-run material override that writes
`<view>-stripped.png` + `contact-stripped.json` beside the lit run's files, so
the two evidence sets never clobber each other). `contact.json` carries
mesh/material/geometry counts, socket and pivot names, and bounds.
`--elevation` overrides the camera pitch — match the reference's (product
shots sit near 0–5°; the defaults are 12–22°) before any silhouette
comparison, or IoU gates false-negative on framing alone. The `raking` view
(azimuth 15°, elevation 3°) is for surface-pass evidence on flat props, where
`side` is dead edge-on. Every run also writes `parts.json`, the runtime part
manifest `check_part_coverage.py --manifest` wants. For the off-axis gates:
`--views az45,az135,az225,az315 --transparent` shoots a diagonal turntable
ring (any `az<degrees>` is a view; `left` = 270° completes the named ring),
and `--export-meshes` dumps world-space `meshes.json` for
`swept_arc_gate.py` — upstream's own exporter script does not exist.

Before any visual compare or tier-1 run, align framing with
`scripts/align_framing.py align` (its `crop` mode is also the crop-zoom tool
the authoring step calls for). Details and traps: `references/spec-contract.md`.

**Always normalize.** Raw output is not shippable here:

- **~26–43% of the file is inlined spec JSON** on `userData.sculptComponent` and
  `userData.actionProfile`, on _both_ the pivot node and the mesh. It is
  authoring provenance and it all reaches the browser.
- It assumes a permissive tsconfig; ours raises ~28 errors on its internals. The
  normalizer marks the file generated-and-unchecked rather than rewriting
  internals that change upstream — safety is enforced at the typed import site.

Name it `<object>-factory.generated.ts` — the `.generated.ts` suffix is what
`oxlint.config.ts` ignores (keeping the generator's `Record<string, any>` out of
`pnpm lint`), and the object-named prefix keeps a second prop from colliding.
Pass `--keep-action-profile` if you read colliders or fracture groups at
runtime.

### 5. Review, then unlock the next pass

Passes are `locked-sequential`. To advance you must supply real evidence:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --no-project $SKILL/scripts/align_framing.py align \
    --reference ref/<name>.jpg --render runs/<pass>/front.png \
    --out runs/<pass>/front-aligned.png
run forge/stage4_review/make_comparison_sheet.py --reference ref/<name>.jpg \
    --render runs/<pass>/front-aligned.png --out runs/<pass>/compare.png

# Write layer-scores.json + feature-reviews.json as FILES in the run dir —
# inline JSON over ~255 bytes is stat'd as a path and dies with ENAMETOOLONG.
run forge/stage4_review/append_review.py spec.json --in-place \
  --pass-id <pass> --fidelity 0.78 --action continue --summary "..." \
  --matched "..." --mismatches "..." \
  --reference-screenshot ... --render-screenshot ... --comparison-image ... \
  --map-stripped-render runs/<pass>/front-stripped.png \
  --ai-vision-score 0.78 --camera-view front \
  --layer-scores-json runs/<pass>/layer-scores.json \
  --feature-reviews-json runs/<pass>/feature-reviews.json
```

Hard requirements on a visual-pass `continue` (full list:
`references/spec-contract.md`): comparison image, score ≥ threshold, all five
layer scores (`silhouetteProportion, componentStructure, formDetail,
materialSurface, lightingCamera`), per-pass critical feature reviews ≥ 0.8,
and — blockout only — a genuinely stripped render (`front-stripped.png`, not
the lit one). Omit `--review-viewpoints-json`; it demands views the shared
camera never produces. There is also a **tier-1 quantitative gate**
(`diagnose_render.py` → `orchestrate_passes.py check`) with a framing trap the
contract file explains — normalize framing and match `--elevation` first, or a
correct model fails on IoU alone.

Two more pieces of evidence `orchestrate_passes.py status` now lists per
visual pass, both cheap:

```bash
# Inside-the-silhouette change vs the previous pass (IoU reads ~11% of cells).
run forge/stage4_review/interior_difference.py runs/<prev>/front.png runs/<pass>/front.png
# Off-axis coverage + through-hole check. Diagonal ring for anything thin:
# the gate zeroes any frame under 3.5% coverage, so an edge-on door/plate
# at 90°/270° reads as a collapsed billboard no matter how it is lit.
run forge/stage4_review/turntable_gate.py \
    --capture 45=runs/<pass>-ring/az45.png --capture 135=... --capture 225=... --capture 315=... \
    --required 45 --required 135 --required 225 --required 315
```

Skip `self_intersection.py` on primitive-assembled props: its ray-parity test
assumes welded, watertight meshes and flags every unwelded `BoxGeometry`
plank and `CylinderGeometry` rivet as self-intersecting (31 of 31 door parts).
It is a character-mesh gate.

**Look at the comparison sheet and score it honestly.** Critical features carry
a hard minimum (0.8) and the gate will refuse you — that is the system working.
When it refuses, _fix the model_, don't inflate the number. Early passes legitimately
score near zero on `formDetail`; say so in the notes and explain what the global
number is weighted to, so the next agent can audit the call. A review history
containing an honestly-failed cycle (`refine-spec`, then a credited retry) is
evidence the gate discriminates — a spec where every review passed first try
reads as rubber-stamping.

Passes emit progressively: **blockout emits macro components only; meso parts
(strapping, plates, fittings) appear at structural-pass.** Before crediting,
run `check_part_coverage.py --spec spec.json --manifest runs/<pass>/parts.json`
— it reconciles spec-vs-built and catches parts the generator silently
skipped. A hand-authored hinge carrier shows up as a `part-not-specified`
note, which is correct: it is an armature, not a part.

## Rendering gotchas that read as broken models

- **Metal renders pure black without an environment map.** A high-`metalness`
  PBR material has nothing to reflect. `render_model.py` supplies a
  `RoomEnvironment`; a game scene must too. The generated material
  **binarises metalness at 0.5** (`0.49 → 0`, `0.5 → 1`) and clamps albedo
  channels to 30–240, so there is no "slightly metallic" — a dielectric with
  a sheen is roughness + clearcoat, not `metalness: 0.4`.
- **Cylinder end caps sample the procedural field in polar UV**, so a lively
  `colorVariation.amplitude` becomes a radial starburst on every flat cap. Keep
  variation low (~0.03) on any material with a visible cap.
- **Coincident circular faces z-fight** into a moiré. Hold a cap ring clear of
  the shell's own end face, or move it fully outboard.
- A part at a parent's local origin sits **inside** the parent. Push it to the
  face (`±0.5` in the parent's local frame) to be seen.

## Wire it into the game

Reach the rig **by the generator's name contracts**, never by traversal order:

- pivots → `"<Component Name>__pivot"` (e.g. `"Domed Lid__pivot"`)
- sockets → `"<componentId>:<socketId>"`, and present in the graph as objects
  whose names contain `socket`

```ts
const model = createTreasureChestModel({ castShadow: true });
const lid = model.getObjectByName("Domed Lid__pivot");
lid.rotation.x = -1.75 * eased;
```

A `__pivot` node rotates about `transform.position` — which is only a hinge if
the spec put the carrier ON the hinge line (see step 3). Animate the pivot
node, never the mesh, and never re-centre or uniform-scale the model to fix
placement; both move the armature off its axes. Position the returned group
instead.

## Say which pass shipped

A blockout described as "a model of the reference" is over-claiming. State the
pass, and name what still does not match — the next agent needs to know whether
the gap is unfinished work or a deliberate stop.
