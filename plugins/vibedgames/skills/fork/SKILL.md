# Forking vibedgames projects

`vg deploy --source` ships the project **source** alongside the built bundle.
Once shipped, any logged-in user can pull it down, re-slug it, and build on it —
that is the remix loop. Source upload is **opt-in**: a plain `vg deploy` ships
the built bundle only.

## Fork an existing project

```sh
vg fork <source-slug> [new-slug]
```

- `<source-slug>` — the project to fork (e.g. `bomberman`).
- `[new-slug]` — directory + slug for your copy. Defaults to `<source-slug>-fork`.
- Downloads the source archive, extracts it into `./<new-slug>/`, and rewrites
  `vibedgames.json` + `package.json` to the new slug (clean slate — no link
  back to the original).
- `--json` emits `{ slug, dir, forkedFrom }` for agent parsing.
- `--force` overwrites an existing target directory.

Then build on it and redeploy under your own slug:

```sh
vg fork bomberman my-bomberman
cd my-bomberman
npm install
npm run dev          # iterate
npm run build
vg deploy ./dist     # ships to my-bomberman.vibedgames.com (bundle only)
```

`vg fork` requires login (`vg login`, or `VG_TOKEN` for headless/agent use).
Most projects ship no source, and fork fails on those with a clear NOT_FOUND —
there's nothing to fork.

## Ship source so others can fork you

Source upload is **off by default**. Opt in per deploy:

```sh
vg deploy ./dist --source
```

Do this only when the user has asked to make the project forkable. Publishing
someone's source without them asking is not a default worth guessing at.

### What's in the source archive

The archive is the **project root** (the directory containing
`vibedgames.json`), gzipped, respecting `.gitignore` and a hard exclude list:

- always excluded: `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`/`build`/`.next`/`.turbo`/`.cache`, logs
- **secrets always excluded**: `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `id_*`, `.npmrc`, `.git-credentials`
- plus anything your `.gitignore` (or a `.vibedgames­ignore`) lists

`vg deploy` prints the file count + size of the source it's about to ship.

> **Source is a publish.** It's forkable by anyone, so never hardcode secrets,
> API keys, or tokens in committed source — read them from env at runtime and
> document the required vars in the README. The exclude list is a safety net,
> not a substitute for not committing secrets.

## Gotchas

- **Globally-unique slugs.** Your fork can't reuse the source's slug; `vg fork`
  re-slugs for you. Pick a fresh, available slug.
- **Workspace/catalog deps.** A forked project keeps its `package.json` as-is.
  If you fork one of the bundled monorepo example games, its deps may use
  `workspace:^` / `catalog:` (monorepo-only) — replace those with concrete npm
  versions (e.g. `@vibedgames/multiplayer: ^<latest>`) before `npm install`.
  Normal standalone projects fork and install cleanly.
- **Source size cap** is 25 MB (archived). Keep large generated assets in
  `.gitignore` if they blow past it; regenerate them via `vg generate`.

## Deploy

See the `deploy` skill for the full deploy flow. The short version:

```sh
vg deploy ./dist --slug <slug>            # live, bundle only
vg deploy ./dist --slug <slug> --source   # live + forkable
```
