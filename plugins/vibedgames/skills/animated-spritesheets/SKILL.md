# Animated Spritesheets

Turn a character into a packed, engine-loadable spritesheet by generating **one
labeled pose-board image** — a grid of the _same_ character in the frames of an
action — then recovering/slicing it. This is the **image-generation** method.

> **Why image generation, not image-to-video.** One generation per action keeps
> identity consistent (cloak/face/weapon stay the same across frames); video
> morphs the character mid-clip. Trade-off: fewer frames (a model reliably lays
> out ~4–12 grid cells, not a long strip), so motion is choppier — per-frame pose
> labels + pixel-snapping make the few frames count.

## The happy path

You are an agent. All scripts run with `node <script>` — no Python, no `uv`, and
nothing to install: each imports a bundled, dependency-free `scripts/_lib/`.

```bash
# This skill's directory. Claude Code substitutes CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR (project, global
# or plugin install); other agents fall back to wherever `skills add` put it.
SKILL="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
[ -d "$SKILL" ] || for d in .agents/skills .claude/skills ~/.agents/skills ~/.claude/skills; do
  [ -d "$d/animated-spritesheets" ] && SKILL=$d/animated-spritesheets && break
done
```

```bash
# 0. (once) An approved character anchor PNG on a flat chroma matte (the identity
#    reference). Make it via the pixel-art skill, or:
node $SKILL/scripts/sprite-prompt.mjs anchor --direction e --chroma '#00FF00'   # -> vg generate run

# 1. ASK what the action needs (frame count / fps)
node $SKILL/scripts/sprite-presets.mjs --action attack --json

# 2. PROMPT — get the labeled pose-board prompt (per-frame semantic poses on an
#    implied 4x3 grid, identical-character + no-shadow litany, the craft):
node $SKILL/scripts/sprite-prompt.mjs pose-board --action attack --direction e --frames 8 \
  --frame-prompt-style specific --pose-board standard --style lobit-v1 --chroma '#00FF00'

# 3. GENERATE the pose board with the anchor as the identity reference. The board
#    is a 4-col x 3-row grid; the first N cells are the frames (4:3 aspect). Use 2K
#    so each cell clears ~512px — pixel snapping (step 4) needs that resolution to
#    recover a clean grid:
vg generate run fal-ai/nano-banana-pro/edit --prompt "<from step 2>" \
  --image_urls '["<anchor_url>"]' --aspect_ratio "4:3" --resolution "2K" \
  --download attack-board.png --json

# 4. PROCESS into runtime frames with ONE command. Default = naive uniform slice
#    (the robust path). Add --recover to re-center a pose that drifted off its cell
#    (it falls back to the uniform slice if it can't, so passing it is always safe):
node $SKILL/scripts/process-sheet.mjs attack-board.png --action attack --rows 3 --cols 4 --frames 8 --out-dir runs/hero-attack
```

> **`--download x.png` does not make the file a PNG.** The model chooses the
> output format, so an endpoint that answers JPEG writes JPEG bytes into the
> `.png` you named, and every script here — they read PNG only, by design —
> rejects it with `Not a PNG file (bad signature)`. `vg generate` warns when

The deliverable is `<out-dir>/spritesheet.png` + `spritesheet.json`, with
`runtime/` frames and `review/<action>.gif`. Load it:

```ts
// spritesheet.json -> { frameWidth, frameHeight, frameCount, fps, animations }
this.load.spritesheet("attack", "assets/hero-attack/spritesheet.png", {
  frameWidth: 256,
  frameHeight: 256,
});
this.anims.create({
  key: "attack",
  frameRate: 10,
  frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers("attack", { start: 0, end: 7 }),
}); // end = frameCount - 1
```

Ship it as PNG or **lossless** WebP (`--columns` so no side exceeds 4096 px — mobile GPUs load a wider strip as an empty texture). Lossy WebP makes pixel-art sheets 51–85% bigger, not smaller.

## What `process-sheet.mjs` does (under the hood)

1. **slice / recover** — default is a naive uniform `--rows × --cols` slice (the
   robust path). `--recover` instead re-centers each cell's foreground component to
   rescue a pose that drifted off-grid; it can't split poses that merged into one
   blob, so it falls back to the uniform slice when it can't fill the cells —
   passing `--recover` is always safe. `--frames N` takes the first N cells.
2. `chroma-clean.mjs clean` — key the matte → fringe → despill → decontaminate
   (global speck-removal so dark/low-contrast sprites stay clean).
3. **pixel snap (on by default)** — recover crisp native pixels from the AI's
   fake-pixel "mixels". All frames are assembled into one strip and snapped
   together so the snapper finds a _single_ grid pitch for the action — every frame
   ends up the same scale, so the character doesn't "breathe" size between frames.
   `--no-pixel-snap` keeps the smooth high-res look (for painterly/non-pixel
   sprites); `--snap-k-colors` sets palette size. Needs ≥~512px cells to work well
   — hence the 2K board (see `pixel-snapper`).
4. `normalize-canvas.mjs` — place each frame on a shared 256×256 anchor with
   **headroom** (`--char-fill`, default ~0.5 of the cell) so attack arcs and big
   poses never clip the edge.
5. `pack-spritesheet.mjs` — pack to `spritesheet.png` + manifest.
6. `sheet-qc.mjs` — QC the packed sheet and report a verdict (same token in the
   `--json` `qc` field and the human badge, just uppercased there): **`clean`** /
   **`review`** (soft hints to eyeball — size outliers, possible facing flips) /
   **`warn`** (hard defects — empty cells, edge-clipping, foot-baseline wander,
   an inked cell grid). Runs automatically; `--no-qc` skips it. **Read the
   verdict:** regenerate the board on `warn`; eyeball `review/<action>.gif` on
   `review`. Run it standalone too: `sheet-qc.mjs sheet.png [--json] [--strict]`.
   The `grid` check deserves special attention: models routinely ink the cell
   outlines despite the prompt forbidding them, and the uniform slice bakes a
   black rule into every frame. That rule then joins each frame's bounding box,
   so size/baseline/facing get measured against the rectangle rather than the
   character — a `grid` warn makes the rest of the report meaningless, so
   regenerate rather than reading past it.

## Craft

- **Consistency is the whole point.** Prompt "identical character, do not redesign
  between frames," and reference the anchor as identity.
- **Headroom.** Draw the character small with margin (~20–50% of the frame) so
  effects/arcs have room.
- **Grid the model can do.** A 4×3 board (first 6–10 cells) is the sweet spot.
  Past ~12 cells the model loses layout consistency.
- **Make it ONE motion, not N poses.** The model's default failure is each cell as
  a separate dramatic pose, so frames jump around instead of tracing one swing.
  Two prompt moves beat this, both built into `sprite-prompt.mjs pose-board`:
  (1) it always frames the used cells as _consecutive film frames of one continuous
  motion sampled at evenly-spaced instants_; (2) with `--frame-prompt-style specific`
  (the default) it writes per-frame labels as **monotonic spatial progression along a single path**
  (weapon back → wind-up peak → mid-strike across centerline → contact →
  follow-through → recover), not abstract beats. **If you add an action** to
  `sprite-presets.mjs` / `frame_label`, label it as progression along one path —
  that, not the frame count, makes it read as motion.
- **Lock the facing.** The model loves to mirror a cell (often frame 1). The
  pose-board prompt pins facing in _every_ cell (`_pose_board_facing_lock`);
  `--direction e`/`w` adds a side-profile lock. `sheet-qc.mjs` catches gross flips;
  eyeball the gif for subtle ones.
- **Lock the scale.** Same _size_ in every cell on a shared foot baseline — pose
  change fine, scale change not. The prompt says so. `normalize_canvas` can't
  un-drift mixed scales, so `sheet-qc.mjs` flags size outliers (sparing monotonic
  pose arcs like a death collapse).
- **Matte.** Flat `#00FF00` (`#FF00FF` if the subject is green). Generate-time
  prompts must forbid baked shadows — the engine adds those.
- **Genre/action data** comes from `sprite-presets.mjs` (frames, fps, profiles).

## Remember

One labeled pose-board image, one consistent character, recovered into frames.
Fewer frames than a video clip, but they're the _same_ character across the whole
animation — which is what a game sprite needs most.

For 3D props built the same generate-one-reference-image way (rigged,
procedural Three.js instead of frames), see `image-to-threejs`.
