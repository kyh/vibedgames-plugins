# Level design

Levels are authored arguments: each one teaches an idea, tests it, twists it,
and concludes. These patterns apply equally to hand-built tilemaps and
code-generated levels — generators should emit the same grammar.

## Core rules

- **Four beats per level (kishōtenketsu** — Hayashida, Super Mario 3D World):
  introduce the mechanic safely → develop with real stakes → twist (one
  variable flipped) → conclude with a capstone. One mechanic per level.
- **The level is the tutorial.** First exposure to anything new cannot kill:
  show the crusher cycling over a pit you can't fall into. Never explain in
  text what geometry can teach (Hayashida; Thorson).
- **Pull with eyes, not arrows (the weenie** — Rogers, via Disneyland): the
  goal or its marker visible from afar; leading lines (platform edges, coin
  trails) aimed along the critical path; one saturated accent color reserved
  for interactables; motion for anything that must not be missed.
- **Experiential density** (Valve's Half-Life cabal): a stimulus — enemy,
  pickup, set piece — every few seconds of _distance traveled_, never timers.
  Audit generated levels for dead stretches >3–4s of travel.
- **Deaths are the player's fault**: telegraph every threat (wind-up, audio
  cue, flash) and leave a readable escape. Surprise kills make players blame
  the game and quit (Valve).
- **Sawtooth difficulty**: rise ~4–5 levels/waves, drop deliberately, rise
  from a higher floor. Every 4th–5th level is a victory lap remixing known
  elements. Rest stops (hazard-free screen, checkpoint, secret) after peaks.
- **Short rooms, instant retry** for execution challenges: death costs <2s,
  respawn at room entry, no fade (Celeste).
- **Two routes per room** where possible: safe-slow vs risky-fast with a
  reward on the risky one (Thorson). Asymmetric layouts — mirror-symmetric
  rooms read artificial.
- **Secrets reward attention, not pixel-hunting**: signal with an anomaly —
  off-pattern tile, coin pointing into a wall.
- **Cut, don't patch**: a room that's still broken after 2 iterations gets
  deleted (Thorson; Valve).

## Build procedure (level set)

1. List verbs (jump, dash, shoot) and hazard primitives. Each verb × hazard
   twist = a level seed. Order easy → hard.
2. Level N teaches seed N using only seeds 1..N-1 as support. Plan the
   sawtooth.
3. Build each level in the four beats: (a) safe demo, can't kill; (b) first
   real test; (c) twist — same mechanic, one variable flipped (bounce pads on
   walls; the chaser now phases through walls); (d) capstone: seed + 1–2 old
   mechanics, densest moment, right before the exit.
4. Place the weenie first, decorate second. Breadcrumb pickups along the
   critical path.
5. Add the risky/safe fork and one signaled secret per level.
6. Audit density (no dead stretches) and failure attribution (every kill
   source telegraphed + escapable).
7. Playtest mechanically: log time-per-room and death positions (a death
   heatmap spike = a telegraphing failure, not "players are bad"). Self-test
   at max speed and min skill.
8. Optional difficulty last, Celeste-style layers: collectible on the risky
   route per level, then a "B-side" hard remix reusing the same tilemap with
   extra hazards — big replay value, near-zero new assets.

## Waves & arenas (endless / horde / score-attack)

- **Wave grammar: build → peak → breather.** 3–5 escalating waves, a spike
  (ambush/boss), then a breather (shop, low pressure). Repeat from higher.
- **Debut enemies kishōtenketsu-style**: new type appears alone in a quiet
  wave → paired with basics → in a surprising configuration → folded into
  the standard mix.
- **Spawn timing is the knob**: the same 10 enemies are a wall (all at once —
  demands AoE/prioritization) or a stream (staggered — demands stamina). Vary
  the pattern per wave (wall / stream / pincer), not just the count.
- **Endless ramp**: `difficulty = sqrt(frames * 0.0001) + 1` is a proven
  starting curve for ~3-minute runs (Kenta Cho / ABA Games) — gentle early,
  ~doubled by 3 min. Scale "tension" parameters (speed, count) linearly with
  it; scale "fairness" parameters (reaction windows, hitboxes) much more
  gently.
- **Arena geometry creates the tactics**: an empty rectangle has one strategy
  (circle-kite). Each feature adds one: pillar → line-of-sight play, choke →
  funneling, hazard zone → area denial, open ground → breathing room. Give an
  arena 3–4 such features.
- **Risk/reward in waves**: bonus points/drops for risky play early — fights
  early-game boredom in score chasers (ABA Games).

## Genre contracts

Per-genre checkable design contracts — what the space must provide before it
counts as designed. Apply on top of the core rules.

- **Arcade racer**: define the handling fantasy first (drift, grip, hover,
  combat). The track owes: readable apexes, braking/drift cues before
  corners, recovery width after mistakes, landmarks for orientation, and a
  route rhythm. Shortcuts cost risk. Skill tests: racing line, boost timing,
  drift angle, traffic threading.
- **Dogfight / space shooter**: pin engagement range, turn rate, projectile
  speed, and lock-on/lead affordance — they define the dance. Encounters
  need target readability, off-screen threat indicators, and deliberate
  moments to reacquire orientation. Objectives must force movement, not
  endless circular chasing.
- **Tower defense**: path topology and chokepoints create the placement
  decisions — a good map has non-obvious tile choices, not one optimal spot.
  Define build zones, tower roles, economy cadence; expose upcoming enemy
  types (wave tells) before they punish.
- **Pool / mini-golf / physics table**: the physics and rules ARE the design.
  Owed affordances: readable aim, force control, spin, legal-target and foul
  feedback, camera reset. Each hole/table: one clear read, one trick, one
  risk/reward route — reject any hole whose first shot is unreadable from
  the tee.
- **Boss fight**: every attack = readable tell → avoid/defend option →
  impact feedback → cooldown (punish window). Phases add combinations and
  arena pressure, never just more health. Define camera-lock behavior and
  arena hazards up front. Pick the next attack by player distance (close →
  swipe, far → lunge/projectile) and forbid immediate repeats — a fixed
  rotation is memorized in two loops and reads arcade-y.
- **Puzzle**: state the rule each puzzle teaches. First puzzle teaches,
  second confirms, third twists. Failure reveals information — no hidden
  dependency chains that force guessing.
