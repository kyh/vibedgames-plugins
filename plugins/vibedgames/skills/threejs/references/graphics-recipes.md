# Graphics Recipes

Concrete material values, shader injection patterns, and cheap visual tricks. Every recipe is copy-pasteable and mobile-conscious. Prerequisite: an environment map and a tone-mapped renderer (see [`advanced-topics.md`](advanced-topics.md)) — without them PBR values below won't read.

The rule for all of it: **effects clarify gameplay, never hide missing geometry.** If a shape only reads because it glows, the geometry is missing.

## PBR Material Recipes

Copy the config, tune `color` to your palette. `envMapIntensity` assumes a `RoomEnvironment` env map. Use `MeshStandardMaterial` unless a `MeshPhysicalMaterial`-only feature (clearcoat, transmission, sheen) is visible during play.

```javascript
// Painted metal (car body, ship hull) — dielectric paint over metal, read via clearcoat
new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
  color: 0x1f6feb,
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.5,
  clearcoat: 0.9,
  clearcoatRoughness: 0.15,
  envMapIntensity: 1.0,
});

// Bare brushed metal (steel, gun frame) — needs the env map to look metallic at all
new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0xaeb4bd,
  metalness: 1.0,
  roughness: 0.4,
  envMapIntensity: 1.1,
});

// Rubber / tire — near-black, kills reflection
new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0x0a0a0b,
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.92,
  envMapIntensity: 0.35,
});

// Matte plastic (housings, crates)
new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0xd23b3b,
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.62,
  envMapIntensity: 0.6,
});

// Glossy ceramic / clean hull — clearcoat for the wet-look premium read
new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
  color: 0xf5f5f5,
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.12,
  clearcoat: 1.0,
  clearcoatRoughness: 0.05,
  envMapIntensity: 1.0,
});

// Emissive signal (beacon, pickup core) — dark base so only the glow reads; >1 intensity feeds bloom
new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0x101010,
  emissive: 0x18e0ff,
  emissiveIntensity: 2.5,
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.4,
});

// Cloth / fabric — high roughness + sheen for the soft edge highlight
new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
  color: 0x3a4a6b,
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.9,
  sheen: 1.0,
  sheenRoughness: 0.5,
  sheenColor: new THREE.Color(0x8899bb),
  envMapIntensity: 0.5,
});
```

**Separate roles by roughness/metalness contrast (matte vs glossy, metal vs plastic), not hue alone.** Two objects with different colors but identical material response read as the same "stuff."

### Glass: real vs fake

```javascript
// REAL refractive glass — transmission
new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.05,
  transmission: 1.0,
  thickness: 0.5,
  ior: 1.5,
  envMapIntensity: 1.0,
});
```

**Cost warning:** every transmissive material triggers an **extra full-scene render into a transmission buffer every frame**. Reserve it for one or two hero surfaces (cockpit canopy, potion vial) at close range. Never use it on repeated or instanced props.

```javascript
// CHEAP fake glass — one transparent draw call, no extra render target.
// Use for repeated windows, visors, shields.
new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
  color: 0x88ccff,
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.1,
  transparent: true,
  opacity: 0.25,
  clearcoat: 1.0,
  envMapIntensity: 1.5,
  depthWrite: false,
});
```

Add the fresnel rim below for a readable edge.

## onBeforeCompile: Inject Into PBR Materials

To add rim glow, dissolve, scrolling emissive, or wind sway to a lit surface, inject GLSL into a stock `MeshStandardMaterial` — you keep the whole PBR lighting pipeline for free instead of rewriting it in a `ShaderMaterial`. Three rules make this safe:

- **Cache key (silent-failure gotcha):** any material whose `onBeforeCompile` injects code **must set `customProgramCacheKey`** returning a string unique to that injection. Without it Three.js can hand back a cached program compiled from a different, un-injected material of the same type — your code silently never runs, and it costs hours.
- **Animating uniforms:** `onBeforeCompile` fires **once** per compiled program, so stash the shader (`material.userData.shader = shader`) and write uniforms each frame: `if (m.userData.shader) m.userData.shader.uniforms.uTime.value = t;`.
- **Sharing:** reuse one material instance across meshes and its uniforms update once for all. For per-object variation, use separate instances (same cache key still reuses the program) or drive it from `instanceMatrix`.
- **Reserved words:** `half` and `patch` are GLSL reserved — an injected `float half = ...` fails to compile. And `customProgramCacheKey` must read `window`/`devicePixelRatio` lazily inside the function, never captured at module load (workers and SSR have no `window`).

### Fresnel rim glow

`vNormal` and `vViewPosition` (view space) already exist in the Standard fragment shader; `saturate` is defined in `<common>`.

```javascript
material.onBeforeCompile = (shader) => {
  shader.uniforms.uRimColor = { value: new THREE.Color(0x33ccff) };
  shader.uniforms.uRimPower = { value: 3.0 };
  shader.uniforms.uRimStrength = { value: 1.5 };
  shader.fragmentShader =
    "uniform vec3 uRimColor;\nuniform float uRimPower;\nuniform float uRimStrength;\n" +
    shader.fragmentShader.replace(
      "#include <emissivemap_fragment>",
      `#include <emissivemap_fragment>
       float fres = pow(1.0 - saturate(dot(normalize(vNormal), normalize(vViewPosition))), uRimPower);
       totalEmissiveRadiance += uRimColor * fres * uRimStrength;`,
    );
};
material.customProgramCacheKey = () => "fresnel-rim";
```

Use for shields, invulnerability states, and silhouette separation from a busy background. Cost: a few ALU ops, no extra passes.

### Scrolling emissive panels

Inject a private UV varying so it works without any texture assigned.

```javascript
material.onBeforeCompile = (shader) => {
  shader.uniforms.uTime = { value: 0 };
  shader.uniforms.uPanelColor = { value: new THREE.Color(0x18e0ff) };
  material.userData.shader = shader;
  shader.vertexShader =
    "varying vec2 vPanelUv;\n" +
    shader.vertexShader.replace(
      "#include <begin_vertex>",
      "#include <begin_vertex>\n vPanelUv = uv;",
    );
  shader.fragmentShader =
    "uniform float uTime;\nuniform vec3 uPanelColor;\nvarying vec2 vPanelUv;\n" +
    shader.fragmentShader.replace(
      "#include <emissivemap_fragment>",
      `#include <emissivemap_fragment>
       float scroll = fract(vPanelUv.y * 6.0 - uTime * 0.5);
       float band = smoothstep(0.46, 0.5, scroll) * smoothstep(0.54, 0.5, scroll);
       totalEmissiveRadiance += uPanelColor * band * 2.0;`,
    );
};
material.customProgramCacheKey = () => "scroll-emissive";
```

Energy conduits, charge bars, boost lanes. Scroll direction/speed should encode state (charging up, draining down).

### Wind sway (foliage, flags)

`transformed` is object space, displaced before `<project_vertex>` applies `instanceMatrix` — so read the instance translation for per-instance phase. Assumes model origin at the base, up = +Y.

```javascript
material.onBeforeCompile = (shader) => {
  shader.uniforms.uTime = { value: 0 };
  material.userData.shader = shader;
  shader.vertexShader =
    "uniform float uTime;\n" +
    shader.vertexShader.replace(
      "#include <begin_vertex>",
      `#include <begin_vertex>
     #ifdef USE_INSTANCING
       float phase = instanceMatrix[3].x + instanceMatrix[3].z;
     #else
       float phase = 0.0;
     #endif
     float h = max(position.y, 0.0); // base stays planted, tips move most
     transformed.x += sin(uTime * 1.5 + phase) * 0.08 * h;
     transformed.z += cos(uTime * 1.1 + phase) * 0.05 * h;`,
    );
};
material.customProgramCacheKey = () => "wind-sway";
```

Grass cards, banners, antennae — background life only. **Never sway collidable/interactable geometry**; visuals drifting off the collider reads as a hitbox bug.

### Dissolve / spawn

Threshold-discard with a glowing edge. Drive `uProgress` 0→1 to despawn, 1→0 to spawn.

```javascript
material.onBeforeCompile = (shader) => {
  shader.uniforms.uProgress = { value: 0 };
  shader.uniforms.uEdgeColor = { value: new THREE.Color(0xff6a00) };
  material.userData.shader = shader;
  shader.vertexShader =
    "varying vec3 vDisPos;\n" +
    shader.vertexShader.replace(
      "#include <begin_vertex>",
      "#include <begin_vertex>\n vDisPos = position;",
    );
  shader.fragmentShader =
    `uniform float uProgress;\nuniform vec3 uEdgeColor;\nvarying vec3 vDisPos;
     float hash13(vec3 p){ p = fract(p * 0.1031); p += dot(p, p.yzx + 33.33); return fract((p.x + p.y) * p.z); }\n` +
    shader.fragmentShader.replace(
      "#include <dithering_fragment>",
      `float n = hash13(floor(vDisPos * 12.0));
       if (n < uProgress) discard;
       float edge = smoothstep(uProgress, uProgress + 0.08, n);
       gl_FragColor.rgb += uEdgeColor * (1.0 - edge) * 3.0; // post-tonemap add feeds bloom
       #include <dithering_fragment>`,
    );
};
material.customProgramCacheKey = () => "dissolve";
```

Enemy death, teleport-in, pickup spawn. `discard` disables early-Z — keep it on spawning objects, not the whole scene. Spawn and destroy must look different (edge color/direction telegraphs which).

## Gradient Sky Dome

Cheaper than a cubemap for stylized outdoor scenes: a `BackSide` sphere with a horizon→zenith lerp plus a sun disc and halo. One draw call, no textures, and a flat clear-color background stops reading as "sparse."

```javascript
const sky = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.SphereGeometry(500, 32, 16),
  new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    side: THREE.BackSide,
    depthWrite: false,
    uniforms: {
      uTop: { value: new THREE.Color(0x3a6fb0) },
      uHorizon: { value: new THREE.Color(0xcfe4f5) },
      uSunColor: { value: new THREE.Color(0xfff2cc) },
      uSunDir: { value: new THREE.Vector3(0.4, 0.28, 0.6).normalize() },
    },
    vertexShader: `varying vec3 vDir;
      void main(){ vDir = normalize(position); gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0); }`,
    fragmentShader: `varying vec3 vDir;
      uniform vec3 uTop, uHorizon, uSunColor, uSunDir;
      void main(){
        float h = clamp(vDir.y * 0.5 + 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);
        vec3 col = mix(uHorizon, uTop, pow(h, 0.6));
        float d = clamp(dot(normalize(vDir), normalize(uSunDir)), 0.0, 1.0);
        col += uSunColor * (pow(d, 800.0) + pow(d, 8.0) * 0.25); // disc + halo
        gl_FragColor = vec4(col, 1.0);
      }`,
  }),
);
sky.frustumCulled = false;
scene.add(sky);
```

Gotcha: a raw `ShaderMaterial` **bypasses tone mapping and sRGB conversion** — author sky colors in display space, and nudge them brighter if the scene runs ACES. Keep the horizon value distinct from anything silhouetted against it.

## Cheap Visual Tricks

Each is one draw call or less, mobile-safe, and solves a constant real need.

- **Fake contact shadow** — a flat `PlaneGeometry` under the object with a radial-gradient `CanvasTexture`, `{ transparent: true, depthWrite: false }`; scale/fade alpha with the object's height. Grounds hovering or moving props with **no shadow pass at all** — the cheapest fix for "everything looks like it's floating."

  ```javascript
  function makeContactShadow(radius = 1) {
    const c = document.createElement("canvas");
    c.width = c.height = 128;
    const ctx = c.getContext("2d");
    const g = ctx.createRadialGradient(64, 64, 0, 64, 64, 64);
    g.addColorStop(0, "rgba(0,0,0,0.4)");
    g.addColorStop(1, "rgba(0,0,0,0)");
    ctx.fillStyle = g;
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 128, 128);
    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
      new THREE.PlaneGeometry(radius * 2, radius * 2),
      new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
        map: new THREE.CanvasTexture(c),
        transparent: true,
        depthWrite: false,
      }),
    );
    mesh.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
    mesh.position.y = 0.01; // just above the ground plane
    return mesh;
  }
  ```

- **Polygon-offset decals** — a coplanar decal mesh z-fights with the surface under it. Fix: `{ polygonOffset: true, polygonOffsetFactor: -1, polygonOffsetUnits: -1, transparent: true }` on the decal material. Panel lines, numbers, faction glyphs, scorch marks. +1 draw call each — instance repeats. (Full toolbox: **Z-Fighting** below.)
- **Vertex-color AO** — bake occlusion into the mesh: darken a `color` attribute in cavities/creases, material `{ vertexColors: true }`. Static props and terrain get contact darkness for one attribute, zero extra draw calls.
- **Matcap background props** — `new THREE.MeshMatcapMaterial({ matcap })` bakes lighting into one texture; needs no lights or env map. The cheapest lit-looking material for background/stylized props. It **ignores scene lights**, so never use it where a dynamic light or state glow must show.
- **Emissive LOD signals** — far pickups/beacons keep reading by swapping `emissiveIntensity` by distance instead of adding geometry. Keep the signal color constant across the swap so identity survives.
- **Plinths and skirts, not terrain surgery** — when a prop's footprint doesn't align to the terrain tessellation, flattening the terrain per cell cuts ramps through the neighbouring tiles. Seat the prop at its highest footprint corner and fill the downhill gap with a plinth/skirt box (2% overlap kills hairline gaps). Seat props and decals on the **drawn** (draped) surface — raycast the mesh or use the drape's own sampler — never on an analytic height field the mesh only approximates.

---

## Pixel-Look Post Pass (dither / pixelate)

Render the scene to a low-res target and nearest-upscale to the canvas. The grid stays square only when one game pixel is an integer number of device pixels: with `PIXEL_SIZE × devicePixelRatio` fractional (DPR 1.25 / 1.75 under Windows scaling) every Nth column is a pixel wider. Snap the renderer's ratio and recompute on resize (DPR changes on zoom and monitor moves):

```javascript
const PIXEL_SIZE = 3; // device px per game px
const fitPixelRatio = () =>
  renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.round(PIXEL_SIZE * devicePixelRatio) / PIXEL_SIZE);
fitPixelRatio();
addEventListener("resize", fitPixelRatio);
```

For a 2-tone dither (ink on paper) only luminance survives: colour is meaningless and anything at or above paper luminance is invisible. Background fills must be unlit `MeshBasicMaterial` darker than the paper, and fades are luminance ramps ink→background, not opacity — opacity on a dithered surface reads as a density change, not a fade.

---

## Z-Fighting: Coplanar Surfaces That Flicker

Two surfaces at the same depth (road markings on a road, a rug on a floor, posters on a wall) flash and shimmer as the camera moves — the depth buffer can't decide which is in front, and the winner changes per pixel per frame. This is the classic "my ground textures flicker" bug. Fixes, in the order to try them:

1. **Separate the geometry** — the robust fix. Lift the overlay along the surface normal by a small epsilon:

   ```javascript
   marking.position.y = road.position.y + 0.01;
   ```

   Size the epsilon to the scene: `0.001` works for a tabletop-scale scene, a city-scale scene viewed from far away needs `0.02–0.05`. If the gap becomes visible at grazing angles, it's too big — drop to polygon offset instead. Stack multiple layers (ground → shadow blob → decal → highlight ring) at increasing offsets, not all at one height.

2. **`polygonOffset`** — when the overlay must hug the surface exactly (decals, selection highlights on walls). Biases the depth test in screen space without moving geometry:

   ```javascript
   new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
     map: decalTex,
     transparent: true,
     polygonOffset: true,
     polygonOffsetFactor: -1, // more negative = drawn "closer"
     polygonOffsetUnits: -1,
   });
   ```

   Stacked decals: give each layer a more negative factor (`-1`, `-2`, `-3`).

3. **`depthWrite: false` + `renderOrder`** — for transparent overlays, opt out of the depth contest entirely and dictate draw order yourself:

   ```javascript
   overlay.material.depthWrite = false;
   overlay.renderOrder = 1; // after the surface beneath it
   ```

   Right for blob shadows, glow quads, ground-target rings. Wrong for opaque geometry — without depth writes, anything drawn later paints over it regardless of actual depth.

4. **Fix depth precision itself** — if surfaces that aren't even coplanar shimmer at distance, the near/far ratio is the problem. Depth precision is spent overwhelmingly near the `near` plane: raising `near` from `0.01` to `0.5` buys far more precision than shrinking `far` ever will. Never set `near: 0` (breaks the depth buffer entirely). `logarithmicDepthBuffer: true` on the renderer is the last resort for huge view distances — it costs performance and breaks materials that read the depth buffer (soft particles, some post-processing).

Debugging tip: if the flicker only happens while the camera is moving and far from the surfaces, it's precision (#4). If it's stable-distance and always the same pair of surfaces, they're coplanar (#1–#3).

---

## Shadow Acne, Peter-Panning & Shadow Flicker

Shadows have three distinct failure looks, and they pull in opposite directions — fixing one by feel usually creates another.

1. **Acne** — dark stripes or moiré crawling across lit surfaces. The surface is shadowing itself: its depth and the shadow map's depth land within one texel of each other. Raise `bias` slightly negative, or better, use `normalBias`, which offsets along the surface normal and doesn't detach contact:

   ```javascript
   light.shadow.bias = -0.0005; // tiny — -0.01 is already far too much
   light.shadow.normalBias = 0.02; // scale to world units; the better first knob
   ```

2. **Peter-panning** — the shadow detaches and the object looks like it floats. This is over-corrected acne: `bias` pushed too far negative. Back it off and lean on `normalBias` instead. If you must keep a large bias, thicken thin casters — a plane casts a shadow no thicker than its geometry.

3. **Flicker at rest, or shadows that swim as the camera moves** — the shadow camera frustum is far larger than what it needs to cover, so each texel spans too much world space. Shrink the directional light's orthographic frustum to the play area, not the whole world:

   ```javascript
   const c = light.shadow.camera; // OrthographicCamera for DirectionalLight
   c.left = -20;
   c.right = 20;
   c.top = 20;
   c.bottom = -20;
   c.near = 1;
   c.far = 60;
   c.updateProjectionMatrix();
   light.shadow.mapSize.set(2048, 2048);
   ```

   Halving the frustum buys the same sharpness as doubling `mapSize`, and costs nothing. Use `CameraHelper(light.shadow.camera)` to see what you're actually covering — most "blurry shadows" are a frustum ten times bigger than the scene.

Runtime rules: **never toggle `light.castShadow` with `shadowMap.autoUpdate = false`** — the light binds a stale depth texture and the console floods with `GL_INVALID_OPERATION`. Fade `light.shadow.intensity` to 0 instead, and after disposing a shadow map force one pass (`renderer.shadowMap.needsUpdate = true`). Static scenes take a one-shot map: `autoUpdate = false` plus `needsUpdate = true` once after setup; shadows off entirely on `(pointer: coarse)`. `PCFSoftShadowMap` is coerced to `PCFShadowMap` in r184 — not a quality knob.

A shadow that outlives the object casting it is not a shadow bug: the mesh was removed from the scene graph but its geometry was never disposed, or a pooled object was hidden with `visible = false` (which still casts). Set `castShadow = false` when parking a pooled object.

---

## Texture Shimmer, Crawl & Moiré

Surfaces that sparkle or crawl while the camera pans — tiled floors, distant detail, thin railings, specular highlights on edges. Three separate causes:

1. **Missing anisotropy** — the default is `1`, which blurs and aliases any texture viewed at a grazing angle. Ground planes and roads are the usual victims:

   ```javascript
   texture.anisotropy = renderer.capabilities.getMaxAnisotropy(); // clamp to 4–8 on mobile
   ```

   Set it on every texture of a surface the camera sees edge-on. It is nearly free compared to how much aliasing it removes.

2. **Antialiasing off** — `new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true })`. Note that `antialias` is ignored once you render through an `EffectComposer`; a post chain needs its own AA pass (SMAA/FXAA) instead, and losing edge AA the moment post-processing was added is a common regression.

3. **Geometry too thin to survive rasterization** — a railing one pixel wide at distance will sparkle no matter the texture settings, because it lands on a different pixel each frame. Thicken the form, or swap to a LOD that removes it entirely past a distance.

Highlights that crawl on curved surfaces are usually neither: they're a too-smooth `roughness` on low-poly geometry. Raise `roughness` slightly or add normal-map detail to break the specular up.
