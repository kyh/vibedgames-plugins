# Vibedgames Deploy

Deploy static browser games to `{slug}.vibedgames.com` using the vibedgames CLI.

> **`vg` not on PATH?** The global install from `vibedgames init` is
> best-effort. If any `vg <cmd>` below fails with "command not found",
> substitute `npx vibedgames <cmd>` — it works identically.

## Starting a new game

If the user has no project yet, scaffold one in a single command. `vg new` pulls the official engine template (or a minimal inline starter) and drops a `vibedgames.json` in place so deploy works without further config:

```sh
vg new my-game                     # Phaser 4 + Vite + TS (official phaserjs template)
vg new my-game --engine threejs    # Three.js + Vite + TS starter
vg new my-game --engine react-r3f  # React + R3F + drei + Vite + TS starter
vg new my-game --engine none       # minimal Vite + TS + canvas (offline; no engine)
vg new my-game --template foo/bar  # any github degit spec
```

Pick the engine that matches the game the user described:

- **2D / pixel-art / arcade / platformer** → `phaser` (the default)
- **3D / first-person / camera-driven, imperative scene code** → `threejs`
- **3D with React component model, declarative scenes, lots of UI overlay** → `react-r3f`
- **Custom engine, plain canvas, or "I'll wire the deps myself"** → `none`

After scaffold:

```sh
cd my-game
npm install
npm run dev        # local preview
```

The matching skill (`phaser`, `threejs`, etc.) will load automatically in Claude Code based on the deps in `package.json`. Pass `--here` to scaffold into the current directory.

## Prerequisites

The game directory must contain an `index.html` at the root. Typically this is the `dist/` output from a build tool (Vite, webpack, etc.).

## Deploy flow

### 1. Make sure the user is logged in

Always check auth before building or deploying. `whoami` exits non-zero
when unauthenticated:

```sh
vg whoami
```

If it prints `Not logged in` (or similar) or exits with an error, run
login _before_ anything else:

```sh
vg login
```

This auto-opens the user's browser to a device-code confirmation page
and prints a 6-character code in the terminal. Tell the user:
"I opened a browser — confirm code `XXXXXX`." Wait for the CLI to
print `Logged in successfully` before continuing. If the browser
didn't open (remote shell, headless env), read the URL from the CLI
output and give it to the user to open manually.

Only skip this step if `whoami` succeeded with a `name (email)` line.

### 2. Build the game (if needed)

If the project has a build step, run it first:

```sh
npm run build
# or: pnpm build, vite build, etc.
```

The build output directory (usually `dist/`) is what gets deployed.

### 3. Deploy

```sh
vg deploy ./dist --slug my-game
```

- `./dist` — the directory containing `index.html` and all assets
- `--slug my-game` — the subdomain name (lowercase, hyphens allowed). The game will be live at `https://my-game.vibedgames.com`

Running `vg deploy` from a project root (a directory with `package.json`)
automatically deploys its build output when one exists — `dist/`, `build/`,
or `out/`, whichever has an `index.html` (the root `index.html` of a
Vite-style project is the source template, not the game). An unbuilt project
root gets a warning. Plain-HTML games (no `package.json`) deploy as-is.

### 4. Verify

After deploy, the CLI prints the live URL. Boot-check it headless before calling it shipped — canvas present, zero page errors, no 4xx sub-resources:

```sh
vg playtest --game my-game
vg playtest wait --fn "document.querySelector('canvas') !== null"
vg playtest errors                 # must be empty
vg playtest network requests       # no 4xx
```

Full recipe in the `playtest` skill. Two expected non-failures: webcam / hand-tracking games throw `NotSupportedError` headless (no camera), and a split-artifact loader's first 404 is its probe (Rules below).

> **Playable on mobile?** Deployed games are shared by link and frequently
> opened on phones. If the game is mouse/keyboard-only, add on-screen touch
> controls (a virtual joystick + buttons) so the link works on a phone — see
> the `gamepad` skill (`@vibedgames/gamepad`). One prompt: "add touch controls".

### 5. Link previews (share card)

Every game gets a share card automatically: when the served HTML has no
`og:` tags, the platform injects them — title from the game name, description
from the page's `<meta name="description">` (add one!), and a cover image.

To ship a custom cover, drop **`og.jpg`** (1200×630+ landscape; `og.png` and
`og.webp` also work) into the deployed directory root (`public/og.jpg` in a
Vite project). No meta tags needed. To fully own share meta instead, add your
own `og:` tags — the platform then serves the page untouched.

## Rules

- **Always build before deploying** if the project uses a build tool
- **Deploy the build output**, not the source directory (e.g. `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`)
- **Preview the build you deploy** (`vite preview`, or any static server on `dist/`). The dev server is not the build — a wrong `base` or absolute asset URL breaks every asset on the deployed path and never shows locally
- **Slug must be lowercase** with hyphens, 3-40 characters (e.g. `space-invaders`, `my-cool-game`)
- **index.html is required** at the root of the deployed directory
- **Caps: 200 MB per deploy, 10 MB per file, 500 files; 100 MB for the `--source` archive** (`packages/api/src/deploy/deploy-router.ts`). The platform never splits files — a >10 MB artifact ships pre-split (`x.bin.0`, `x.bin.1` + `x.parts`), and a loader that probes the unsplit path first turns that 404 into the probe, by design
- **Version-bust unversioned immutable assets.** Everything except `index.html` and the `og.*` cover is served `max-age=31536000, immutable`, so a rebaked `world.bin` on the same path never reaches a returning browser. Hash the filename or append `?v=REV`. The edge cache is keyed per deployment id; the browser cache is yours
- **Guard `localStorage`.** Games run inside the web app's iframe; an unguarded access throws on boot and the game is dead. Wrap reads and writes in `try`/`catch` and treat storage as best-effort
- If the user doesn't specify a slug, ask them for one or derive it from the project name
- If `vibedgames.json` exists in the deploy directory, the slug is read from there automatically

## Config file (optional)

Create `vibedgames.json` in the project root to skip the `--slug` flag:

```json
{
  "slug": "my-game",
  "name": "My Cool Game"
}
```

Then just: `vg deploy ./dist`

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in"** → Run `vg login` first
- **"No index.html"** → You're deploying the wrong directory. Use the build output.
- **"Slug taken"** → Someone else owns that slug. Pick a different one.
- **Build fails** → Fix build errors before deploying. Check for missing dependencies.
- **Blank page live, fine on the dev server** → Static base path. Check `base` in the Vite config and any `/asset` absolute refs; reproduce with `vite preview` before redeploying.
- **Over 500 files** → A project root with models/source got picked up. Deploy the build output explicitly: `vg deploy ./dist`.
- **File over 10 MB** → Split it at bake time and reassemble in the loader (Rules); the CLI will not do it for you.
- **Rebake invisible to returning players, fresh browser sees it** → Unversioned immutable path. Bust it (Rules).
